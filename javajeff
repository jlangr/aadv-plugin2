Modern Java Practices:

Use functional stream methods when appropriate
Declare local variables as `var` when possible

Functional Programming:

No mutating local variables.
Extract complex expressions to separate functions.
Avoid temporaries unless necessary.

Clean and Clear Code:

Extract complex expressions within chained streams
Simplify assignment statements by extracting right-hand sides to new methods
Move related methods to helper classes with high cohesion

Unit testing:

Do not start test names with the word "test"
In tests, also use `var` where possible
